        Creating A Pop-up search bar as a Chrome Extension

      <p>TLDR;</p>

      <h2 id="chromeextensions">Chrome Extensions</h2>
      <p>
        One of my favorite facets of being a developer has been the control I
        can find and exploit throughout all of my favorite softwares. Chrome has
        particularly powerful customization options available to the users by
        allowing them to import and share js scripts to each other in a
        component-based solution known as chrome extensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way that chrome interacts with these scripts is by loading them into
        memory along with a .json file that gives the extension it's meta-data
        and permissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        So in order to create a pop-up search bar we must separate the steps and
        tackle them. We will first go through creating a manifest file, then
        head into the basic html/css we will need, finally we will create the
        meat of the javascript.
      </p>
      <h2 id="manifestjson">manifest.json</h2>
      <p>
        Chrome's manifest files can be found specifically
        <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest">here</a>. The
        only required piece of code we need to be a valid extension is:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="json language-json">//manifest.json
{
  // Required
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "versionString",
}
</code></pre>
      <p>
        However, in this case we will want to be able to click on the icon and
        make a searchbar appear. We will also need to send it permissions to be
        able to send html requests and open up tabs on chrome. Chrome gives us
        these options as permissions and actions which we must define in the
        manifest.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="js language-js">//Our more complete manifest.json
{
  "name": "DDG Search Bar",
  "version": "1.0.0",
//This tells the extension what permission we want to allow.
  "permissions": ["tabs", "http://*/*", "https://*/*"],
  "browser_action": {
//This tells the extension where to look for the HTML file we want to launch. 
    "default_popup": "launcher/launcher.html"
  },
  "manifest_version": 2
}
</code></pre>
      <p>
        More of these permissions and actions can be found on their
        <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devguide">website</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="launcherhtml">launcher.html</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>launcher.html</code> file will give us what to display on the
        screen, combined with a little CSS we can create a search bar that will
        appear on our screen.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="launcher.css" /&gt;
  &lt;script src="launcher.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="launcher" placeholder="search duckduckgo" /&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p><img src="../images/05/beforesc.png" alt="The searchbar!" /></p>
      <p>I will avoid the CSS for the sake of screen brevity.</p>
      <p>
        What is important here is that none of it looks out of place from
        regular HTML. We can now run through the javascript in order to get to
        the fun.
      </p>
      <h2 id="launcherjs">launcher.js</h2>
      <p>
        We want our javascript to handle three things, user experience when it
        opens, forming URL on a submit request, and finally sending the URL
        request to chrome as a duckduckgo query.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly we can call focus to the extension by selecting it and giving it
        focus. Luckily javascript makes this very easy on us.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="js language-js">document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () =&gt; {
  const launcher = document.getElementById("launcher");
  launcher.focus();
  launcher.select();
});
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Next we want on 'enter' to form a url. In this case since I am using
        DuckDuckGo I can go and take their query submission url return it from a
        function.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="js language-js">function createURL() {
  const url = document.getElementById("launcher").value;
  const ddg = "http://www.duckduckgo.com/?q=";
  return ddg + url;
}
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Finally we can leverage the chrome api and create a new tab going to the
        url. I will throw this into the event listener and will call the chrome
        api on a keypress of enter.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="js language-js">document.addEventListener('keydown', e =&gt; {
  const key = e.keyCode;

  if (key === 13) {
    const url = createURL();
    //This will create a new tab with the submitted url.
    chrome.tabs.create({
      url: url
    });
  }
});
</code></pre>
      <h2 id="gettingitinchrome">Getting it in Chrome.</h2>
      <p>
        Luckily, chrome makes this as easy to install as it was to write. If you
        navigate to the url <code>chrome://extensions</code>. We click on load
        unpacked and navigate to the project folder. After loading it in it is
        ready to go.
