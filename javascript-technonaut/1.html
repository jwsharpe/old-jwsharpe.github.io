        Creating an adaptive Card Focused webpage using nested CSS-Grid.
      </h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_grid_layout">CSS Grid</a> is
        a layout manager that allows for easy implementation of adaptive
        layouts. Just like Flex-box, this layout manager is built into CSS and
        is relatively new. And as compared to Flex or Float layouts, I believe
        that Grid is the most intuitive for CSS novices as it allows programmers
        a very simplistic model for transferring physical pen-paper prototypes
        onto website pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this tutorial we are going to build a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)"
          >'holy grail'</a
        >
        style website. The main content box will be filled with grid cards that
        will adapt to the shape of the container. We will begin to build this
        website from the top to the bottom.
      </p>
      <h2 id="creatingtheholygrail">Creating the Holy Grail</h2>
      <p>
        Firstly, we want to build a frame that will support a header, left-bar,
        right-bar, main content and footer container. CSS Grid gives us a very
        visual way to concoct a design.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="scss language-scss">#container {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 75px 1fr 75px;
      grid-template-rows: 100px 1fr 100px;
      grid-template-areas:
        "header header header"
        "leftbar main rightbar"
        "footer footer footer";
    }
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        This CSS sets up our container to contain 5 different layout workspaces
        in grid. New to Grid is the <code>fr</code> unit. This will allow us to
        divide up space fractionally by the remainder of the container. In our
        case, our layout will have a statically defined header, sidebars and
        footer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to connect these grid areas, we simply use the
        <code>grid-area: name;</code> function.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="css language-css">#header {
      grid-area: header;
      background: #d32f2f;
    }
    
    #footer {
      grid-area: footer;
      background: #2196f3;
    }
    
    #leftbar {
      grid-area: leftbar;
      background: #ffeb3b;
    }
    
    #rightbar {
      grid-area: rightbar;
      background: #ffeb3b;
    }
    
    #main {
      grid-area: main;
      padding: 8px;
    }
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        <img src="../images/02/helloworld.png" alt="Image" />
        <em
          ><a href="https://codepen.io/jwsharpe/pen/BaBeMyJ"
            >Play Around Here.</a
          ></em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that in our case, the id/class methods in CSS do not correspond
        to the area names automatically. We have to set them using the
        <code>grid-area</code> function.
      </p>
      <h2 id="creatingacard">Creating a Card</h2>
      <p>
        Now let us create a card view in order to populate our main area in our
        website. Once again we will be using grid to make card views. The design
        for these cards are shameless stolen from the
        <a href="https://material.io/components/cards/">Material Design</a>
        philosophies, but the implementation will be done with grid.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="scss language-scss">.card {
      height: 300px;
      width: 250px;
      display: grid;
      grid-template-rows: 40% 1fr;
      box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
    
      .card_photo {
      box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
      background: #f44336;
      }
    
      .card_content {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-rows: 40px 1fr 40px;
    
        .card_title {
        color: #212121;
    
        font-weight: 800;
        align-self: center;
        padding-inline-start: 16px;
        }
        .card_description {
        color: #757575;
        padding-block-end: 8px;
        padding-inline-start: 16px;
        padding-inline-end: 16px;
        }
        .card_action {
        color: #2196f3;
        font-weight: 800;
        align-self: center;
        padding-inline-start: 16px;
        font-size: 0.8em;
        }
      }
    }
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        Besides all of the flavor styling used to create a card layout, many of
        the techniques used to create the layout was embedding grid within a
        grid layout. The card component is separated into picture/content, and
        is further separated in the content tab by, title, description and
        action.
      </p>
      <p>
        This design choice will allow us to quickly modify the card's content if
        it is ever needed.
      </p>

          ></em
        >
      </p>
      <h2 id="embeddingmoregrid">Embedding More Grid</h2>
      <p>
        We might feel bound at this point if we try to add another card to the
        main container. Luckily for us CSS Grid also gives us a way to populate
        and fill a space by wrapping these card components. After adding 10
        cards, let us modify our <code>#main</code> tag in order to support
        wrapping of content.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="css language-css">#main {
      grid-area: main;
      padding: 8px;
    
      display: grid;
      grid-gap: 8px;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 250px);
    }
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        We then can embed another grid display into our html. This one includes
        the
        <code>repeat(auto-fill)</code> function which will allow css grid to
        populate card content and wrap the container's items around to give us a
        responsive layout.
      </p>
      <p>
        And to clean it up let's add another line of code that will center the
        cards in the container.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="css language-css">#main {
      grid-area: main;
      padding: 8px;
    
      display: grid;
      grid-gap: 8px;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 250px);
      justify-content: center;
    }
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        <img src="../images/02/cards.png" alt="image" />
        <em
          ><a href="https://codepen.io/jwsharpe/pen/eYOaxRO"
            >Play Around Here.</a
          ></em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we have a fully adaptable card layout that will fill card views in
        depending on the size of the screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not the only way to go about this design, nor is it the most
        efficient way. But it gives a great overview of how powerful CSS Grid
        can be and the simple setup it requires.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you haven't had a chance to visit the codepens, they give programmers
        a very easy way to play and modify html/css/js front end code right in
        the browser.
