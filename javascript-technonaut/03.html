        <h2 id="javascriptvarletandthejsinterpreter">Javascript: var, let and the JS interpreter</h2>
<p>When I first started learning JS I was very focused on the weirdness of the language. What works, what doesn't and what that means to me practically.</p>
<p>One of the first issues I ran into while using JSX with React is this code.</p>
<pre><code class="jsx language-jsx">return
    &lt;div&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/div&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>Most people who use JSX immediately spot the issue in that since I did not wrap the divs around parenthesis the Javascript interpretter will read this code as the following.</p>
<pre><code class="jsx language-jsx">return;
&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>This leads into the situation where the function's return value is null instead of a JSX element. I was fortunate enough to be pair programming at the time and my friend let me know of this truth immediately and we moved on.</p>
<p>But it got me thinking into other cases where the Javascript interpretter does something funky. These reinterpretations of my code gave way to bugs and errors that could be very tricky to spot.</p>
<p>While preparing for more Javascript interviews I ran across a async problem that used <code>var</code> and <code>let</code>. The question gives two sets of code and asks for the difference between them.</p>
<p>What does foo log? What does bar log?</p>
<pre><code class="js language-js">function foo() {
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() =&gt; {
      console.log(i);
    }, 50);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="js language-js">function bar() {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() =&gt; {
      console.log(i);
    }, 50);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The only difference between these two is the use of <code>let</code> and <code>var</code>. If we throw both into the JS console on chrome we get that <code>foo()</code> will output <code>3, 3, 3</code> and <code>bar()</code> will output <code>0, 1, 2</code>. Why is that?</p>
<p>This is due to variable hoisting in javascript and how scope is determined by the interpretter.</p>
<p>The main difference between <code>let</code> and <code>var</code> is where the interpreter wants to define the initalization of the element.</p>
<p>Elements initalized with <code>var</code> will be in function scope. Elements initalized with <code>let</code> will have block scope. So if we were to rewrite the following problems to how the javascript interpreter wants to read it we would get.</p>
<pre><code class="js language-js">function foo() {
  var i;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() =&gt; {
      console.log(i);
    }, 50);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="js language-js">function bar() {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() =&gt; {
      console.log(i);
    }, 50);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And since we are defining <code>i</code> in <code>foo</code> outside of the for loop, after the timeout is called back and javascript queues up to read <code>console.log(i)</code> the only <code>i</code> stored in memory is the global variable <code>i</code>.</p>
<p>In the case of <code>i</code> in <code>bar</code>, when the console.log is queued up there exists three instances of <code>i</code> that occupy different areas of memory in javascript with three different values of <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>2</code>.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TLDR;</h2>
<p>It is due to this scoping of <code>let</code> that makes it more safe to use in a setting where not writing code matters, but reading code matters more.</p>
<h2 id="wheretogo">Where to go.</h2>
<p>There is a lot of information on this subject I wish I knew more about before running into these issues. The MDN web docs say a lot about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let">let</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">var</a>.</p>
<p>A book which helps explains Javascript throughly and helps gives programmers a way to not find themselves in corners is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/">Javascript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford</a>.</p>
