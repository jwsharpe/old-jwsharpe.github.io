        Implementing Simple Collision Handling with Ruby2D
      </h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.ruby2d.com">Ruby2D</a> is a fantastically simple to
        use 2D graphical gem with minimal setup. With just a few lines of code
        we can prototype application interfaces and graphical visualizations.
        For instance, the code below supports a magnificent box.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="ruby language-ruby">require "ruby2d"
    
    Square.new(
      x: Window.width / 2 - 100,
      y: Window.height / 2 - 100,
      size: 200,
      color: ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"],
    )
    
    Window.show
    </code></pre>
      <p><img src="../images/2019-9-8/simple_box.png" alt="Image" /></p>
      <p>
        Ruby2D also advertises itself as a gem for creating games. It has
        seamless support for controller/keyboard input interactions with just a
        <a href="http://www.ruby2d.com/learn/input/">few lines of code</a>.
        However, "game engine"-like implementation is bare and many of the
        methods we might want to see in a game-gem are not implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, even if users can move objects around with their keyboards, Ruby2D
        does not supplies us with convienient methods for checking
        object-to-object interactions.
      </p>
      <p>Without these interactions, Pac-Man could not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interact with ghosts, so the player cannot lose.</li>
        <li>Interact with pellets, so the player cannot win.</li>
        <li>Interact with walls, so the player can walk through them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although not being able to lose the game is great, being an immortal
        yellow entity in a useless maze with no win condition is arguably worse.
      </p>
      <p><img src="../images/2019-9-8/wakawaka.png" alt="Image" /></p>
      <p>
        In order to motivate collision handling, we are going to deal with
        player interaction with a block wall. Ideally, I would like my code to
        emulate the following:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="rb language-rb">if(!player.collides_with?(wall))
         player.move(x, y)
    end
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        That is, if our player is not interacting with the wall, have the player
        move freely. However if the player is interacting with the wall,
        disallow the player to move through it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Ruby2D does not supply us with any of these methods, besides the
        update funciton, we have to create all of them from scratch. For the
        sake of brevity, we are only going to deal with the
        <code>collides_with?</code> method. We want this method to return
        <code>true</code> when two objects are overlapping and
        <code>false</code> when they are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Ruby2D does not give us all the information we want
        natively. Although, we can calculate the space the two objects occupy
        and compare if they overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to do so, we are provided with the location, height and width
        of any object on the screen. We can leverage that to check if an
        object's area is inside another object's area. The only hiccup will be
        understanding what the
        <code>.x</code> and <code>.y</code> methods return.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2 id="locationhandling">Location Handling</h2>
      <p>
        Typically in graphics we have to deal with
        <code>(x,y)</code> coordinates to specify the location of objects.
        Canonically, we deal with these coordinates as a pair.
      </p>
      <p>
        So in our case, <code>x</code> represents the perpendicular distance
        from the left border of the window to the left border of the object and
        similarly, <code>y</code> represents the perpendicular distance from the
        top border of the window to the top border of the object. (Notice that
        <code>y</code> is measuring the distance from the top instead of the
        bottom like we might be used to.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the point given by <code>(x,y)</code> will be the top left corner
        of our object.
      </p>
      <p><img src="../images/2019-9-8/pixel_perfect.png" alt="Image" /></p>
      <p>
        In order to find the four corners of this object we can use quick maths
        involving the location, width and height.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="rb language-rb">#The point class takes in an x,y cordinate.
    player.corners[0]=Point.new(x        , y         )
    player.corners[1]=Point.new(x + width, y         )
    player.corners[2]=Point.new(x        , y + height)
    player.corners[3]=Point.new(x + width, y + height)
    </code></pre>
      <p><img src="../images/2019-9-8/squiggly.png" alt="Image" /></p>
      <p>
        This will just give us the corners of any rectangle. If we wanted the
        corners of more complicated objects, more complex math would be
        required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we can check if any point is within another rectangle by checking if
        a point is in the area created by it.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="rb language-rb">#Is point.x between the two x points given by the rectangle?
    (pt.x &gt; rect.x &amp;&amp; pt.x &lt; rect.x + rect.width) &amp;&amp;
    #And is the point.y between the two y points?
    (pt.y &gt; rect.y &amp;&amp; pt.y &lt; rect.y + rect.height)
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        Now we can check if the box is in the wall by iterating through the
        points.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="rb language-rb">player.corners.any? do |pt|
        (pt.x &gt; rect.x &amp;&amp; pt.x &lt; rect.x + rect.width) &amp;&amp;
        (pt.y &gt; rect.y &amp;&amp; pt.y &lt; rect.y + rect.height)
    end
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        The above code will give us true if the player is in the wall and false
        if the player is not. Finally we can wrap the above in a method and have
        our collision detection.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="rb language-rb">def collides_with?(rect)
        self.corners.any? do |pt|
            (pt.x &gt; rect.x &amp;&amp; pt.x &lt; rect.x + rect.width) &amp;&amp;
            (pt.y &gt; rect.y &amp;&amp; pt.y &lt; rect.y + rect.height)
        end
    end
    </code></pre>
      <p>So now we can prevent players going through walls.</p>
      <p><img src="../images/2019-9-8/triptych_wall.png" alt="Image" /></p>
      <p>
        Instead of letting them pass..

        Understandably, this is a very basic approach to collision detection.
        However, it is a great first step into programming game-engine features.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was also a fantastic way to play around with Ruby2D and see the
        limitations and stengths.
