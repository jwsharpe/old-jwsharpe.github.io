## Using React State Hooks to make a 'Like' Button

The React team released hook in React 16.8 in order to let you use state and other features without having to write class methods. Although [hooks are in no way trying to replace classes](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#no-breaking-changes). They arguably create cleaner code that is easier to follow and debug.

## Into the counter

I created a small react test app using create-react-app. In it I created an example counter on a card.

Currently, the like button does nothing. If we are familiar with class components and statefulness the pre16.8 safe way of adding this like button deals with creating a state object in a class component and calling setState with a callback to get previous values. 

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class Card extends React.Component {
    state: {
        likes: 0
    }

    handleClick = () => {
        setState( (prevState) => {
            return {likes: prevState.likes + 1}
        })
    }

    render(){
        return (
            //...other renderables
            <p className='likes'>{this.state.likes}</p>
            <button onClick={this.handleClick}>like</button>
            //...other renderables
        )
    }
}
```

Although this way works it is verbose and a bit difficult to follow for newcomers. The hook solution removes our need for class components which allows us to avoid the `this` keyword. It also allows us to also avoid the `setState` callback function syntax.

In order to get to hook best practice we will first create a functional component. 

```jsx
const Card = () => {
    return null;
}
```

We will replace the state object with the new useState() syntax. We first have to import the function from react.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const Card = () => {
    const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);
    return null;
}
```

If the `useState` syntax seems foreign, it is because it uses javascript's [array destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment). As a quick aside, we can use array destructuring to assign variables to values in an array.

```js
const [a, b] = [1, 2] // a = 1 and b = 2
```

The function `useState()` returns an array with two values, the first value is the default value passed into the function, in this case 0. The second value is a function that allows us to change this value. Just like with class state we want to avoid modifying state value directly. 

So in order to go from 0 likes to 1 we can simply use the line

``` setLikes(1); ```

And since we assigned the value ```likes``` when the Virtual DOM updates, the value of likes will also change.

Hooks also gives us a safe way to reference previous values of ```likes``` without worrying about racing conditions. So we can avoid callback functions on setState entirely. 

Coming back to our component example we can now get rid of the state object and simply create all of other functionality like normal.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const Card = () => {
    const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);

    const handleClick = () => { setLikes(likes + 1) }

    return (
        //...other renderables 
        <p className='likes'>{this.state.likes}</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>like</button>
        //...other renderables 
    )
}
```

And now our good boi deserves all the likes he wants.

## Where to go.

There is alot more to hooks then just using state. We can also do similar things to [component mounting and updating](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html). 

[Custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) also make it easier to develop and share useful functions. Such as easy to implement [debouncing functions](https://usehooks.com/useDebounce/).

I would also highly encourage you to visit the [beautiful react hooks repo](https://github.com/beautifulinteractions/beautiful-react-hooks) for more inspiration and cool usage.
