## CSS: Modern UI with clip-path

Web traffic continues to grow and more websites are starting to pop up and compete to grab user attention. As people tend to turn to the cutting edge, UI/UX designers continue to pursue more dynamic and attention grabbing layouts. 

In the earlier days of web development a lot of curvy and dynamic interfaces would be implemented by a great hack of CSS tricks and background images. Or customly implemented using SVG and paths. 

However CSS continues to develop and more developer-friendly ways of constructing a layout and curved surfaces continue to appear. 

## clip-path

As front end engineers continue their learning, a handy tool to know for implemented UI is `clip-path`. Like masking, `clip-path` fulfills a similar role and allows developers to portion their containers and only show a unique perspective of the work behind them.

A quick way to create a circular mask is as follows.

```html
<style>
#masked {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.2);
  clip-path: circle(25%);
}
</style>
<body>
    <div id="masked">Hi I'm masked!!</div>
</body>
```

## Transitions

The fun things with masks is that we can also combine them with transitions to create some fill in effects. Using ```transition``` with ```clip-path``` creates some very nice designs. Here is an example of a multiple part tab design with mask transitions.

## Where to go.****

There is a lot of neat options with ```clip-path``` along with SVG options. But you should check them out at [Mozilla's web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path).
